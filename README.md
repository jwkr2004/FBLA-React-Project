# Student Event Tracker
Student Event Tracker is a website that you can track students points if they joined events and it can show them what events they can join. This was created for FBLA 2022-2023 competitions.

## Build Status
There should be no errors throughout the code and everthing should be working.

## Tech/Framework used
We used Visual Studio Code to Test and program the website. We also used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try4?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_general-phrase_prosp-brand_gic-null_ww-multi_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=p&utm_ad_campaign_id=11295578158&adgroup=116363205048&cq_cmp=11295578158&gclid=Cj0KCQjwla-hBhD7ARIsAM9tQKsM9K9cEUZiEyYTC1bGeTK9P_uLZIG0CHSVaaDxnq8R8JTowDA5zokaAv-HEALw_wcB) to store all of the data.

## Features
This website has many features like a login system, tracking user active, creating and storing data in a database.

## Requirements
Install Node on the desktop first. Then install the following the following node modules:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en)

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

## Installation
Install all of the modules in the node terminal. Then install MongoDB Compass[https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass] on your computer.

## Configuration
First you open a terminal in the backend folder and then type "Npm run dev". Then open a second terminal that in the main folder and type "Npm start".

## Troubleshooting

If the page does not start make sure you have installed all the modules and that it is connected to the [Mongo database](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try4?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=search_gs_pl_evergreen_atlas_general-phrase_prosp-brand_gic-null_ww-multi_ps-all_desktop_eng_lead&utm_term=mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=p&utm_ad_campaign_id=11295578158&adgroup=116363205048&cq_cmp=11295578158&gclid=Cj0KCQjwla-hBhD7ARIsAM9tQKsM9K9cEUZiEyYTC1bGeTK9P_uLZIG0CHSVaaDxnq8R8JTowDA5zokaAv-HEALw_wcB).
